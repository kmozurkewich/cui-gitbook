# CUI Icons
Version 1.0


### Description


### Usage Example
Replace #covisint-logo with the name of your svg and set viewBox to your svg's size.



```html
  <svg class="cui-header__svg-logo" viewBox="0 0 640 124"><use xlink:href="bower_components/cui-icons/dist
```

### How it works / features
To add icons to Covisnt UI Library

1. Add your icons to src/resources/logos or src/resource/icons depending on what type of icon you're adding.
2. Jenkins will run node generateSvgList.js and grunt build which will compile all the icons into 2 different output files - dist/icons/icons-out.svg and dist/logos/logos-out.svg. These will be availabe to consumers of this library (bower install --save cui-icons).
Notes:

Note: Your icons will need to follow a certain syntax to be accepted by the build task:
* No hardcoded fills (or it won't be customizable with css)
* All the paths should be wrapped in a group with an id equal to its filename. (everything outside of that group will be ignored
